```



## Repository structure
The main structure of this repository is taken from [Carla Garage](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage). Please check it out for more detailed information.

**CARLA**: We have the `leaderboard_autopilot` and `scenario_runner_autopilot` folders for running data collection. The `leaderboard` and `scenario_runner` folder are currently mostly unused (they just contain the route files for evaluation) but can be used to run evaluation on the CARLA eval routes or longest6_v2 or other benchmarks (see [Carla Garage](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage)). The folder `Bench2Drive` (with its own leaderboard and scenario_runner folders) is used to run closed-loop eval on the Bench2Drive Benchmark. The `team_code` folder is used for all files to run closed-loop agents in carla (for the expert, simlingo and simlingo_base).

**Training**: `simlingo_base_training` and `simlingo_training` contain all files to run training. `simlingo_training` also contains the files to start the language evaluation.

**Dataset**: Our dataset is stored in a folder called `database`.

## Dataset generation
If you download our dataset from Huggingface, you don't need to follow any of the steps from this section.
If you only want to perfrom closed-loop driving evaluation, there is no need to download our dataset.

### Driving Data

This repository uses the open-source expert PDM-Lite from the paper [DriveLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14150) to generate the driving dataset. Most of the code for the data collection is taken from [Carla Garage](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage). However, we changed some hyperparameter and used the data_agent from DriveLM which saves the required auxiliary information during data collection which is needed to generate the VQA and commentary data.

**Generate driving data:** To re-generate the data, we provide a script for a SLURM cluster, which parallelizes data collection across many GPUs (2080ti in our case). First, adjust the paths etc. in lines 213-230 of [collect_dataset_slurm.py](collect_dataset_slurm.py). You can specify the SLURM partition in [partition.txt](partition.txt) and change it during runtime. [max_num_jobs.txt](max_num_jobs.txt) specifies how many parallel SLURM jobs are submitted. This can also be changed during runtime. The data collection is started via `sbatch 0_run_collect_dataset_slurm.sh`, which calls `collect_dataset_slurm.py`. 
Increase the number in [max_num_jobs.txt](max_num_jobs.txt) once your setup works. 

**Dataset cleaning:** After the dataset is collected you can use `dataset_generation/delete_failed_runs.py` and `dataset_generation/delete_infraction_routes.py` to delete routes where the expert failed or carla crashed and the routes had to be restarted.

**Route files:** The routes for data collection are stored in [data/simlingo](data/simlingo/). **Note:** These are different route files as used in the Carla Garage. To generate our route files, you can use the following script that generates our modified route files from the original Carla route files: `bash dataset_generation/split_route_files.sh`
This splits the long training and validation route files provided by Carla into short routes with max 1 or 3 scenarios and balances and upsamples the scenarios.

PDM-Lite uses a modified version of the CARLA leaderboard that exposes additional information about the scenarios and makes data collection easier. They can be found in the [leaderboard_autopilot](leaderboard_autopilot) and [scenario_runner_autopilot](scenario_runner_autopilot) folders.

The dataset provided in this repository is not perfect. At some point while improving the model, you will likely need to collect an improved version.

### Data buckets
Our bucket file is included in the released dataset. Check out our Huggingface repo.
If you want to generate your own buckets you can use the script `dataset_generation/data_buckets/carla_get_buckets.py`.

### Language Data
**VQA (DriveLM):** We use the script (with minor modifications) from [DriveLM](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveLM/tree/DriveLM-CARLA) to generate VQA labels. You can run `dataset_generation/language_labels/drivelm/carla_vqa_generator_main.py` to generate the VQA labels for your dataset. We used ChatGPT to augment the questions and answers. We provide the augmented templates, which we load during training in the folder [data/augmented_templates/drivelm_train_augmented_v2](data/augmented_templates/drivelm_train_augmented_v2). An example script to generate those augmented sentences can be found here: [dataset_generation/get_augmentations/gpt_augment_vqa.py](dataset_generation/get_augmentations/gpt_augment_vqa.py). **Note:** To be able to generate the VQA labels we save many auxiliary information of the simulator state during data collection. If you use a different dataset, it is likely that this labelling script does not work.

**Commentary:** In this work we provide a new script to generate commentary labels. To generate commentary labels for your dataset, run `dataset_generation/language_labels/commentary/carla_commentary_generator_main.py`. We used ChatGPT to augment the questions and answers. We provide the augmented templates, which we load during training in the folder [data/augmented_templates/commentary_augmented.json](data/augmented_templates/commentary_augmented.json). Unfortunately, based on how the project evolved the augmentations were first done manually for subsentences and later merged. If helpful, we provide the subsentence level augmentationes [here](data/augmented_templates/commentary_subsentence.json) and the script to merge those to the final ones [here](dataset_generation/get_augmentations/commentary_merge_augmented.py). **Note:** To be able to generate the commentary labels, we save auxiliary information of the simulator state during data collection. If you use a different dataset, it is likely that this labelling script does not work.

_File structure:_
``` bash
"image": # Path to RGB image
"commentary": # Commentary string (not augmented)
"commentary_template": # Commentary with placeholders for changing parts (e.g., object description, location). This is used to retrieve the augmentations.
"cause_object_visible_in_image": # Whether the object that causes the expert actions is visible in the front view image. Could be used to filter samples where the commentary describes an action based on an object not visible.
"cause_object": # Dictionary with attributes of the object causing the expert action.
"cause_object_string": # Language description of the cause object (e.g., dark green car that is to the front)
"scenario_name": # Name of the active CARLA scenario
"placeholder": # Dictionary to be able to replace the placeholders in commentary_template.
```

### Dreamer Data
To improve the alignment of language and actions, we propose _Action Dreaming_ for which we provide a dataset with multiple different future trajectories given a language instruction. The language instructions cover a wide range of modes (e.g., speed changes, lane changes, object-centric navigation, crashes) with a label indicating whether the execution is allowed and safe or not. 
To generate the labels, run `dataset_generation/dreamer_data/dreamer_generator.py`.

_File structure:_
``` bash
category: # e.g. "target_speed", "stop", "faster", "crash", ...
      "waypoints": # Dreaming waypoints
      "route": # Dreaming path
      "rgb_path": # Path to RGB image in dataset
      "allowed": # Flag if execution is allowed.
      "mode": # category
      "info": # more information, e.g., about current, target, and final speed
      "route_reasoning": # Language description about the route.
      "dreamer_instruction": # Language instruction.
      "instructions_templates": # Instruction with placeholders for changing parts (e.g., object description, location). This is used to retrieve the augmentations.
      "templates_placeholders": # Dictionary to be able to replace the placeholders in commentary_template.
      "dreamer_answer_safety": # Answer when safety mode is activated.
      "safe_to_execute": # Flag if the instruction is safe to execute.
```

## Training
We provide code for the smaller model SimLingo-Base (previously CarLLaVA - without language capabilities) in the folder `simlingo_base_training` and for the full model SimLingo in `simlingo_training`. For the config managment we use hydra. The config parameters are defined in the `config.py` file and can be adjusted in the `.yaml` files inside the `config` folder. **Note:** You should double check if the paths to the dataset is correct.

We provide a SLURM script to start training: [train_simlingo_seed1.sh](train_simlingo_seed1.sh). This can be easily converted to a bash script to locally start the training. The entry file for training is [simlingo_training/train.py](simlingo_training/train.py).

With the default config, the training logs to Wandb. Login is required. We also include a visualization callback that plots ground truth and predicted waypoints during training.

To enable the disk-backed dataset cache on slow filesystems, pass the following Hydra overrides (cache lives in `/tmp/<dataset_cache_name>` on each node):
```bash
python simlingo_training/train.py \
  data_module.base_dataset.use_disk_cache=true \
  data_module.base_dataset.dataset_cache_name=simlingo_cache \
  data_module.base_dataset.dataset_cache_size_gb=1600
```

To pre-stage the full dataset into `/tmp` before training (no caching), pass:
```bash
python simlingo_training/train.py \
  data_module.base_dataset.use_data_prestage=true \
  data_module.base_dataset.dataset_prestage_name=simlingo_prestage
```

## Evaluation

The model file can be downloaded from huggingface: https://huggingface.co/RenzKa/simlingo.
If you only want to perfrom closed-loop driving evaluation, there is no need to download our dataset.


### Bench2Drive
Bench2Drive is a CARLA benchmark proposed by the paper [Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03877). It consists of 220 very short (~150m) routes split across all towns with 1 safety critical scenario in each route.
Since it uses all towns for training, the methods have seen the test towns during training, so it can be considered a 'training' benchmark (reminiscent of level 4 driving).
The benchmark also comes with a training dataset generated by the [Think2Drive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16720) expert, but we use the open-source expert [PDM-Lite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14150) that achieves better resuslts and can be adapted to collect the necessary labels to produce VQA, Commentary and Dreamer data.
The benchmark and additional instructions can be found in the [Bench2Drive](Bench2Drive) folder.

**Start eval:** Evaluation on a SLURM cluster can be run with [start_eval_simlingo.py](start_eval_simlingo.py). The config dictionary needs to be adjusted with the correct names and paths. Most things that need to be changed are marked with TODO tags in [start_eval_simlingo.py](start_eval_simlingo.py). 

**Get results:** The script [Bench2Drive/tools/merge_route_json.py](Bench2Drive/tools/merge_route_json.py) can be used to obtain the final metrics after the evaluation is done. Make sure that all 220 routes are evaluated.

The Bench2Drive folder is based on version 0.0.3 of the [Bench2Drive repository](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive). Please cite the [Bench2Drive paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03877) when using the benchmark.

### Language eval
NOTE: Files might get cleaned at some point in the future (maybe not, depending on my time). Since the dataset and model are a reproduction and not the original ones from the paper, numbers deviate slightly. However, conclusions drawn in the paper still hold. We will update the numbers shortly.

Entry point for the language evaluation is [simlingo_training/eval.py](simlingo_training/eval.py). Please change the variable `eval_mode` to `QA`, `commentary` or `Dreaming`.
Afterwards, to obtain the metrics you can run [simlingo_training/eval_metrics.py](simlingo_training/eval_metrics.py). For this you first need to specify an OpenAI key here: [simlingo_training/utils/gpt_eval.py](simlingo_training/utils/gpt_eval.py)
